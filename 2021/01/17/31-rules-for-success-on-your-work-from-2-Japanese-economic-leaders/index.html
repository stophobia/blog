        <ol>
<li><p>‘Work’ is not a hobby. It is enough if you enjoy your hobbies. On the other hand, work is something I do for someone, not me. In other words, it can only be done when it is helpful to the customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers are not limited to people outside the organization. Because there are people in the organization who also need my work. All of our colleagues are customers, and we can only call it’work’ only when we are recognized by them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘To be good at work’ means’to produce results’. A person who does a good job is a person who is trusted by customers,’If you are this person, you can leave your work with confidence.’ Furthermore, it is the person who evaluates the customer as’it must be this person’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In today’s unpredictable world, logical management alone cannot lead a business. In order to cope with a problem where there is no correct answer and cannot cover black and white, it is necessary to have an ability different from rational and logical thinking, that is,’sense’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>English, presentation, financial skills, etc. can be shown to others. But’sense’ is not. If you want to be technically good, you just have to take the time to work. On the other hand, sensation cannot be measured on a specific scale, and it is the ability to intervene by various factors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the computer came out and the problem was solved, a virus came out. And virus removal software was needed. This problem-solving also creates new problems. In the eyes of highly skilled people, there is already a problem to be solved by a person with a good sense, although it is already over-solved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logic and intuition do not conflict. Logic always requires intuition. The two concepts are connected by ‘order’. Why did you think of X and Y among the numerous concepts in’If X, the more X becomes Y’? ‘Intuition’ was triggered. The field of problem solving to establish a logical hypothesis is a world of senses rather than a world of technology.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In sports, the standards of competition are set, so if someone wins, someone loses. However, business is about setting up a strategy for each and making a difference. We must break away from the’sports-type business’ competing for a limited market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>High-growth companies are like large sailing ships. Since the wind is blowing, you can all go in the same direction. But the right company for today is a cruiser, not a sailboat. There must be a prime mover on board, and the captain has to decide for himself which direction to go. Each of us must go in a different direction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A sense of realizing technology and knowledge into the real world is important. There were three types of “successful diplomats” announced by Harvard University. First, recognize the other person’s feelings well. Second, there is a belief that you can build horizontal and constructive relationships. Third, it reads the dynamics within the organization well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person who works well is like’a friend who wants to be on the same side as a child’. It’s the person who makes people think,’I don’t care because this friend is on our team’ or’I want to be on the same side as this guy’. Even at work, he is a person who makes people think, ‘I wish he was this person’</p>
</li>
<li><p>There must be something only I can do. There are many people who are usually good at it. But no one pays on average. If you look at a restaurant with regular customers, it has its own outstanding characteristics and a personality that no other store can replace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person who is really good feels’it is natural to know how to do it’. It’s hard to realize that that ability is your own strength that no one else can. On the other hand, your own strengths, which you think of yourself, usually miss. Only those who can objectify and analyze their situation can grasp their strengths.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is human nature to be generous to yourself. People usually overestimate themselves. The best way to self-objectify is to see yourself from the customer’s point of view. People who are good at work think about what they were pleased with when they did, and they try to do the same to others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In juniors, you can get a good evaluation just by following it properly, but the quality of your work will change as you raise your position. Problems that could be solved with logic before, gradually decrease. The structure is completely different between being good at work until the third year, that the manager is doing well, and that the executives are doing well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are geniuses and brilliant talents within a person. Usually, from the inside, the genius crushes the genius. The brightest tries to rely only on stable technology, and the genius tries to pursue the senses. To rely on the senses, anxiety strikes. However, the higher you go, the more you need to know how to use the talent of genius, not the skill of brilliant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generalists aren’t just people without expertise. Originally,’general’ is the general manager, in short, the head. A person who leads the entire organization and is responsible for the results. If the Specialist gets the job done well as a brilliant person, then the Generalist has to show his senses and lead the entire organization in the direction he decides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practitioners and managers should have different attitudes toward work. The essence of work is to create ‘a state of division of labor but not completely divided’. Managers should develop a sense of overseeing the whole so that practitioners do not think,’This is my job and I will achieve it forever.’</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is’customer’s willingness to pay-price = corporate profit’. There are only three ways to increase profits: 1) increase ‘payment’, 2) increase ‘price’, 3) do two things at the same time. In other words, you should be able to think about everything, a phone call, and a line of notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sense of working is to see the whole and solve real problems. For example, when a customer wants something out of stock, politely apologizing is the realm of technology. Furthermore, it is the working sensation to create a fundamental solution, a situation where out of stock does not repeat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a sense of work judges well whether or not it is something they should do. This takes experience. When it comes to baseball, it’s about hitting a ball of various pitches and realizing’I can hit the ball well by pulling the outer low pitched ball’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When Gustner brought IBM back to life, he didn’t mention keywords like “vision management” or “Agile” as expected by the media. He jumped into the field and commanded. He was looking for customers and asked, “What do you not like about IBM?”</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is important to a pro is the order in which you do things and the sequence of your work. Tasks are not just items of tasks listed. Because there is A, there is B, and when there is B, C comes out, so it has a chronological meaning. The permutation problem of deciding’in which order’ is completely different from prioritizing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The person who throws the’fast ball’ is not a professional, but the person who throws the’quick ball’ is the real professional. The pitcher combines several balls. That is a strategy. The fastball looks fast after throwing a slow curve. There is no secret weapon in comic books, but this is the effect of temporal depth and flow.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A leader should reveal ‘behavior’ what he wants to do, not his ‘state’. It shouldn’t be just the “state” that keeps you alive. The original management is to present direction or express a desire to realize a certain goal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leaders should not be obsessed with linking organizations horizontally. Before that, you need to share the information your leader has. Then the horizontal network naturally grows. Business managers must send information from top to bottom to execute work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is also a distinction of’work is work’ for people with sense. It works with passion, but it has a slightly cool side. The important thing here is ‘distribution of consciousness’. If work makes up too much of your life, your vision may become narrow and you may end up with a work addict.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the current situation of X to the ideal state of Y, there are several layers of logic. Stories that lead to highly probable logic that everyone can relate to are the conditions for strategy. If the logic does not stand, the power of persuasion is insufficient, and in the end, it cannot be carried out because everyone does not agree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When my daughter started her social life, she gave me three tips. First, say ‘hello’ or ‘thank you’ no matter who you meet. This is 80% of the skills you need in the early stages of social life. The second was’bora’. It means to keep looking at the people who are good at work and to catch what’s important. And the third is’think from the customer’s point of view’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efforts to hone your skills are important. However, the effort to develop the senses and the effort to create a strategy is more important. What kind of positioning and concept you should aim for to win, and your efforts to hone your own strengths is a real effort.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to know what you know, what you don’t know, and what you want to get answers to. Studying without clarifying this is instantly reassuring. However, the relief goes further and further away from the direction in which you are good at work.</p>
</li>
